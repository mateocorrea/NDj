# NDj
Final Project for 6.s08 

We’re implementing a cubed shaped speaker system called NDj that plays songs off of an SD card. NDj uploads the list of songs to our server which accesses the Spotify API and organizes our list based on genre and BPM. This is intended to mimic an actual DJ which orders songs so that they have smooth transitions and play in a coherent order. The Arduino then retrieves this new list of song order and plays them. Additionally, we’ll implement gesture recognition so that if we shake we play in shuffle mode; if we pivot the cube about an edge we either skip forward. If we spin the cube, it goes back one song. This recognition will be implemented with gesture recognition based off the IMU readings. Lastly, we’ll use our microphone to choose a genre and start playing that section of our playlist. The cube will also have LEDs for visual attractiveness and feedback. If the user doesn’t want to use gestures or voice commands, he will be able to use integrated buttons to control the music.
